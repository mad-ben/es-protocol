      <h2>20-20-20 Rule</h2>
      <p>The 20-20-20 rule is a simple and effective technique to help developers and computer users reduce eye strain and fatigue from prolonged screen time. 
        The rule states that every 20 minutes, you should look at something 20 feet (6 meters) away for at least 20 seconds. Longer breaks are recommended.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="recommendations">
      <h2>Longer Breaks May Be More Effective</h2>
      <p>While the 20-20-20 rule can be helpful, some scientists suggest that breaks longer than 20 seconds may be more effective for reducing eye strain and fatigue. 
         Researchers have found that breaks of 5 minutes or more per hour may be needed to have a meaningful impact on reducing the accommodative and vergence responses that occur during prolonged near work.</p>
    
      <h2>The Importance of Outdoor Time</h2>
      <p>In myopia, the eye grows too long, causing poor focus for distant objects. The retina's normal growth control falters during myopia development. Research suggests that increasing dopamine levels in the eye can help regulate eye growth and counteract the effects of near work, ultimately reducing the risk of myopia development.
        One of the most effective ways to increase dopamine is by spending time outdoors and exposing my eyes to natural light. Studies have shown an inverse relationship between outdoor activity and the risk of developing myopia.
        While it's not possible to naturally revert myopia once it has developed, as the eye has already changed its shape, taking proactive steps to prevent myopia can have long-term benefits for my vision health.</p>
